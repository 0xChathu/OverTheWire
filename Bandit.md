Successfully completed. I mamaged to log in via ssh to the overthewire as bandit user via my terminal.

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

#### Notes 
Port 2220 is typically used for Secure Shell (SSH) traffic, which enables users to securely access and manage remote systems and devices over a network. It is a common port used for SSH connections, particularly in cases where the default SSH port (22) has been blocked or restricted.
